# ðŸŽµ Gesture Symphony: Playing Music Using Hand Gestures

## Overview

**Gesture Symphony** is an innovative project that enables users to play **simplified musical instruments using hand gestures**. It leverages **computer vision, deep learning, and human-computer interaction (HCI)** to provide a new, intuitive way to create music without the need for traditional instruments.

This project was developed as part of a **Bachelor Semester Project** at the **University of Luxembourg**.


## Features

âœ… **AI-Powered Hand Gesture Recognition**: Uses a **deep learning model** (CNN) to recognize **static hand gestures**  
âœ… **Real-Time Hand Detection**: Detects hand movement using **OpenCV and Mediapipe**  
âœ… **Interactive Music Playing**: Users can perform musical notes by showing **predefined hand gestures**  
âœ… **Customizable Dataset**: Train the model with new gestures to create personalized experiences  
âœ… **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple, intuitive interface for non-musicians and beginners  

## Technologies Used
- Python: Main programming language
- Keras & TensorFlow: Deep learning framework for CNN model training
- OpenCV & Mediapipe: Real-time hand tracking and segmentation
- Pandas & NumPy: Dataset handling and processing
- Matplotlib: Data visualization

## Hand Gesture Recognition
- Hand Segmentation: Detecting hands in real-time using OpenCV and HSV color filtering
- Deep Learning Model: Uses a CNN with multiple layers to classify gestures
- Palm & Finger Detection: Extracts key points to differentiate gestures
- Gesture-Music Mapping: Assigns gestures to specific notes or actions

## Analysis & Insights
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Used for pattern recognition in hand images
- Hand Pose Estimation: Identifies key hand positions using finger segmentation
- AI & HCI Integration: Merging machine learning with usability principles
- User Experience Optimization: Making gesture-based controls intuitive and accessible
